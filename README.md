# exodus-nes-text-inserter
This code helps to insert the text of the questions from the NES game called "Exodus - Journey to the Promised Land (USA) (v4.0) (Unl)" by "Wisdom Tree". Make sure it has this hash before using it:<br>
`ROM CRC32: AB26DB6`

Usage: Copy this file into the same directory as the NES file the use  
`inserter.py <textfile.txt> <nesfile.nes>`

If you used my [extractor](https://github.com/KodingBTW/exodus-nes-text-exporter), you shouldn't have any problems using the inserter.
